"Explain this:n""Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20 reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.""",gpt-4.1

"Explain this:nLarge pretrained Transformer language models have been shown to exhibit zeroshot generalization, i.e. they can perform a wide variety of tasks that they werennot explicitly trained on. However, the architectures and pretraining objectivesnused across state-of-the-art models differ significantly, and there has been limitednsystematic comparison of these factors. In this work, we present a large-scalenevaluation of modeling choices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. Innparticular, we focus on text-to-text models and experiment with three model architectures (causalnon-causal decoder-only and encoder-decoder), trained withntwo different pretraining objectives (autoregressive and masked language modeling), and evaluated with and without multitask prompted finetuning. We trainnmodels with over 5 billion parameters for more than 170 billion tokens, therebynincreasing the likelihood that our conclusions will transfer to even larger scales.nOur experiments show that causal decoder-only models trained on an autoregressive language modeling objective exhibit the strongest zero-shot generalizationnafter purely unsupervised pretraining. However, models with non-causal visibility on their input trained with a masked language modeling objective followednby multitask finetuning perform the best among our experiments. We thereforenconsider the adaptation of pretrained models across architectures and objectives.nWe find that pretrained non-causal decoder models can be adapted into performantngenerative",gpt-4.1

"Summarize:nOur work revolves around the concept of memory in neural architectures. Memory has been anrecurrent theme in neural network research, dating back to early works (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943;nStephen, 1956) and significantly advancing in the 1990s with the introduction of the BackpropagationnThrough Time learning algorithm (Werbos, 1990) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neuralnarchitecture (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Contemporary memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) typically utilize some form of recurrent external memory separate from the modelsnparameters. Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Networks (Westonnet al., 2015) are equipped with storage for vector representations accessible through an attentionnmechanism. Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) were designed tonenable reasoning through sequential attention over memory content.nNTMs, followed by Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) and Sparse DNCn(Rae et al., 2016), are implemented as recurrent neural networks capable of writing to memorynstorage over time. All these models are differentiable and trainable via backpropagation throughntime (BPTT). Parallel research lines extend recurrent neural networks, such as LSTM, with datanstructures like stacks, lists, or queues (Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Grefenstette et al., 2015).

"Please summarize this research paper, and explain it in simple termsnnAbstractnStructured State Spaces for Sequences (S4)nis a recently proposed sequence model withnsuccessful applications in various tasks,ne.g. vision, language modeling, and audio.nThanks to its mathematical formulation,nit compresses its input to a single hiddennstate, and is able to capture long rangendependencies while avoiding the need fornan attention mechanism. In this work, wenapply S4 to Machine Translation (MT), andnevaluate several encoder-decoder variantsnon WMT14 and WMT16. In contrastnwith the success in language modeling, wenfind that S4 lags behind the Transformer bynapproximately 4 BLEU points, and that itncounter-intuitively struggles with long sentences.nFinally, we show that this gap isncaused by S4s inability to summarize thenfull source sentence in a single hidden state,nand show that we can close the gap by introducingnan attention mechanism.n1 IntroductionnThe Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is the mostnpopular architecture for state-of-the-art NaturalnLanguage Processing (NLP) (Devlin et al., 2019;nBrown et al., 2020; NLLB Team et al., 2022). However,nthe attention mechanism on which it is builtnis not well suited for capturing long-range dependenciesndue to its quadratic complexity (Ma et al.,n2023).

"summarize this email ""In May well recognise the Mental Health Foundations awareness week (15-21 May), aimed at encouraging more conversation around mental health and well-being. Even if youre not personally in need of mental health support, Im sure many of us will know at least one person who has experience of poor mental health. nAt Amazon, I dont recall ever getting to the end of a day, or week, and thinking Ive done everything on my To Do list. Therefore, we need to form healthy habits to help us prioritise the most important things on that list, and to be able to switch off (literally) from work. I do this by taking regular walks with our dog, Nula, making time to get outside during the working day, and spending time with my family.nI am encouraged by how much more were talking about mental health in society as a whole, with sports stars and celebrities in particular helping to raise awareness of this critical topic. But I know there can be stigma around mental health, whether driven by fear, or misunderstanding. And all too often there is silence, when we should be having conversations. nLast year we ran a workplace well-being survey in the UK with Mind, and we know that some Amazonians are nervous about confronting the issue, especially at work. We need to, and will do better.""",gpt-4.1-nano

"Rephrase in academic style: The model architecture consists of an input layer with shape (n, 33, 1), where n represents the number of previous network flows, 33 represents the length of each input sequence, and 1 represents the number of input channels, indicating a single-channel representation for 33 input values. The CNN layer extracts relevant features from the input sequence and includes a variable number of filters, kernel size, activation function, padding, strides, and dropout. All these parameters are optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) Bayesian optimization technique. Two LSTM layers with variable units, activation functions, and recurrent activation functions are optimized by TPE to facilitate learning of temporal dependencies in the input sequence. An attention layer is appended to the LSTM layers output to weigh the input sequences various components based on their task relevance. A dense layer follows with an output size of 1 and a sigmoid activation function to yield a binary output. The model compilation employs a binary cross-entropy loss function and a TPE-optimized optimizer. Training the model on the dataset utilizes early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting.

"Differentiability When working with a function yf(x)yf(x) of one variable, the function is said to be differentiable at a point xaxa if f(a)f(a) exists. Furthermore, if a function of one variable is differentiable at a point, the graph is smooth at that point (i.e., no corners exist) and a tangent line is well-defined at that point. The idea behind differentiability of a function of two variables is connected to the idea of smoothness at that point. In this case, a surface is considered to be smooth at point PP if a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. If a function is differentiable at a point, then a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. Recall the formula for a tangent plane at a point (x0,y0)(x0,y0) is given by zf(x0,y0)fx(x0,y0)(xx0)fy(x0,y0)(yy0),zf(x0,y0)fx(x0,y0)(xx0)fy(x0,y0)(yy0), For a tangent plane to exist at the point (x0,y0),(x0,y0), the partial derivatives must therefore exist at that point. However, this is not a sufficient condition for smoothness, as was illustrated in Figure 4.29. In that case, the partial derivatives existed at the origin, but the function also had a corner on the graph at the origin. Definition A function f(x,y)f(x,y) is differentiable at a point P(x0,y0)P(x0,y0) if, for all points (x,y)(x,y) in a δδ disk around P,P, we can write f(x,y,z)f(x0,y0)fx(x0,y0)(xx0)fy(x0,y0)(yy0)E(x,y),f(x,y,z)f(x0,y0)fx(x0,y0)(xx0)fy(x0,y0)(yy0)E(x,y), (4.26) where the error term EE satisfies lim(x,y)(x0,y0)E(x,y)(xx0)2(yy0)2",gpt-4.1

This work presents MedSAM, the first attempt at extending the success of SAM to medical images, with the goal of creating a universal tool for the segmentation of various medical targets. Specifically, we first curate a large-scale medical image dataset, encompassing over 200,000 masks across 11 different modalities. Then, we develop a simple fine-tuning method to adapt SAM to general medical image segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on 21 3D segmentation tasks and 9 2D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAM outperforms the default SAM model with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 22.5 and 17.6 on 3D and 2D segmentation tasks, respectively.",gpt-4.1-nano

"Summarize in one sentence: CMR-derived myocardial strain analysis differentiates ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathya propensity score-matched studynnLeft ventricular (LV) longitudinal, circumferential, and radial motion can be measured using feature tracking of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. The aim of our study was to detect differences in LV mechanics between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) who were matched using a propensity score-based model. Between April 2017 and October 2019, 1224 patients were included in our CMR registry, among them 141 with ICM and 77 with DCM. Propensity score matching was used to pair patients based on their indexed end-diastolic volume (EDVi), ejection fraction (EF), and septal T1 relaxation time (psmatch2 module L Feature tracking provided six parameters for global longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain with corresponding strain rates in each group. Strain parameters were compared between matched pairs of ICM and DCM patients using paired t tests. Propensity score matching yielded 72 patients in each group (DCM mean age 58.6u2009u200911.6 years, 15 females; ICM mean age 62.6u2009u200913.2 years, 11 females, pu2009u20090.084 and 0.44 respectively; LV-EF 32.2u2009u200913.5 vs. 33.8u2009u200912.1, pu2009u20090.356; EDVi 127.2u2009u200930.7 mlm2 vs. 121.1u2009u200941.8 mlm2, pu2009u20090.251; native T1 values 1165u2009u200958 ms vs. 1167u2009u200970 ms, pu2009u20090.862). There was no difference in global longitudinal strain between DCM and ICM patients ( 10.9u2009u20095.5 vs. 11.2u2009u20094.7, pu2009u20090.72),",gpt-4.1-nano

"What is myocardial strain analysis in this context?nnHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction is one of the leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in industrialized nations 1. The most common aetiologies of heart failure are ischemic (ICM) and dilative (DCM) cardiomyopathies 1,2,3. Although they have the same phenotype, structural myocardial changes underlying the reduced ejection fraction (EF) are different. Ischemic burden primarily affects the subendocardial compartment of the myocardium, only transmural infarction leads to a fibrotic replacement of the whole myocardial wall 4, 5. In contrast, DCM affects endocardial as well as epicardial compartments 6.nnLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) is known as a reproducible and easily assessed parameter that has prognostic value for many cardiac diseases. Nevertheless, LV-EF is a crude parameter of LV function and does not reflect LV mechanics of myocardial fibres in depth 7, 8. Furthermore, it has been shown that myocardial fibre function can be impaired while global LV function is still normal 8.nnTorrent-Guasp developed the concept of the cardiac band, which is helically folded to form different layers of myofibres, that are orientated in oblique angles to each other 9. The advent of modern imaging techniques like diffusion tensor imaging or micro-CT has further elucidated the concept in vivo and shown that myocyte aggregates are organised in a mesh-like structure, supporting the idea of oblique angles within the mes",gpt-4.1

"Summarize this text: ""In machine learning, backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward artificial neural networks or other parameterized networks with differentiable nodes.12 It is an efficient application of the Leibniz chain rule (1673)3 to such networks.4 It is also known as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation or reverse accumulation, due to Seppo Linnainmaa (1970).567891011 The term 'back-propagating error correction' was introduced in 1962 by Frank Rosenblatt,124 but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J. Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation13 already in 1960 in the context of control theory.4nnBackpropagation computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single inputoutput example, and does so efficiently, computing the gradient one layer at a time, iterating backward from the last layer to avoid redundant calculations of intermediate terms in the chain rule; this can be derived through dynamic programming.131415 Gradient descent, or variants such as stochastic gradient descent,16 are commonly used.nnThe term backpropagation strictly refers only to the algorithm for computing the gradient, not how the gradient is used; however, the term is often used loosely to refer to the entire learning algorithm, including how the gradient is used, such as by stochastic gradient descent.17 In 1985, David E.

"First, some basic Stable Diffusion prompting rules for you to better understand the syntax. The parentheses are there for grouping prompt words together, so that we can set uniform weight to multiple words at the same time. Notice the "":1.2"" in (masterpiece, best quality, absurdres:1.2), it means that we set the weight of both ""masterpiece"" and ""best quality"" to 1.2. The parentheses can also be used to directly increase weight for single word without adding "":WEIGHT"". For example, we can type ((masterpiece)), this will increase the weight of ""masterpiece"" to 1.21. This basic rule is imperative that any parentheses in a set of prompts have purpose, and so they must not be remove at any case. Conversely, when brackets are used in prompts, it means to decrease the weight of a word. For example, by typing ""bird"", we decrease the weight of the word ""bird"" by 1.1.nNow, I've develop a prompt template to use generate character portraits in Stable Diffusion. Here's how it works. Every time user sent you ""CHAR prompts"", you should give prompts that follow below format:npre-defined prompts, location, weather, pose, facial expression, outfit, accessories, random prompt,npre-defined prompts are always the same, which are ""RAW, (masterpiece, best quality, photorealistic, absurdres, 8k:1.2), best lighting, complex pupils, complex textile, detailed background, 1girl, Emilia_Clarke, skinny body, piercing_blue_pupils, pale skin, flowing hair, brown_hair"".

William Kingdon Clifford introduced hisngeometric algebra in the 1870s, building on the earlier work of Hamilton andnGrassmann. It is clear from his writing that Clifford intended his algebra tondescribe the geometric properties of vectors, planes and higher-dimensional objects.nBut most physicists first encounter the algebra in the guise of the Paulinand Dirac matrix algebras of quantum theory. Few then contemplate using thesenunwieldy matrices for practical geometric computing. Indeed, some physicistsncome away from a study of Dirac theory with the view that Cliffords algebranis inherently quantum-mechanical. In this book we aim to dispel this belief byngiving a straightforward introduction to this new and fundamentally differentnapproach to vectors and vector multiplication. In this language much of thenstandard subject matter taught to physicists can be formulated in an elegantnand highly condensed fashion.

"Explain this in simpler terms: n For solving combinatorial optimisation problems with metaheuristics, different search operators are applied for sampling new solutions in the neighbourhood of a given solution. It is important to understand the relationship between operators for various purposes, e.g., adaptively deciding when to use which operator to find optimal solutions efficiently. However, it is difficult to theoretically analyse this relationship, especially in the complex solution space of combinatorial optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose to empirically analyse the relationship between operators in terms of the correlation between their local optima and develop a measure for quantifying their relationship. The comprehensive analyses on a wide range of capacitated vehicle routing problem benchmark instances show that there is a consistent pattern in the correlation between commonly used operators. Based on this newly proposed local optima correlation metric, we propose a novel approach for adaptively selecting among the operators during the search process. The core intention is to improve search efficiency by preventing wasting computational resources on exploring neighbourhoods where the local optima have already been reached. Experiments on randomly generated instances and commonly used benchmark datasets are conducted. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms commonly used adaptive operator selection methods.",gpt-4.1-nano

"Article: BAKHMUT Mr Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of Russian mercenary force Wagner Group, said in a sudden and dramatic announcement on Friday that his forces would pull out of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which they have been trying in vain to capture since last summer.nnMr Prigozhin said they would withdraw next Wednesday ending their involvement in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war because of heavy losses and inadequate ammunition supplies. He asked defence chiefs to insert regular army troops in their place.nnI declare on behalf of the Wagner fighters, on behalf of the Wagner command, that on May 10, 2023, we are obliged to transfer positions in the settlement of Bakhmut to units of the Defence Ministry and withdraw the remains of Wagner to logistics camps to lick our wounds, he said in a statement.nnIm pulling Wagner units out of Bakhmut because in the absence of ammunition, theyre doomed to perish senselessly.nnBakhmut, a city of 70,000 people before the start of the war, has taken on huge symbolic importance for both sides because of the sheer intensity and duration of the fighting there.nnWagner has been spearheading Russias attempt to capture it and Mr Prigozhin said three weeks ago that his men controlled more than 80 per cent of the city.

The Russian word ""Sputnik"" means ""companion"" (""satellite"" in the astronomical sense).nnIn 1885 Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first described in his book, Dreams of Earth and Sky, how such a satellite could be launched into a low altitude orbit. It was the first in a series of four satellites as part of the Sputnik program of the former Soviet Union and was planned as a contribution to the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958). Three of these satellites (Sputnik 1, 2, and 3) reached Earth orbit.nnThe Sputnik 1 satellite was a 58.0 cm-diameter aluminum sphere that carried four whip-like antennas that were 2.4-2.9 m long. The antennas looked like long ""whiskers"" pointing to one side. The spacecraft obtained data pertaining to the density of the upper layers of the atmosphere and the propagation of radio signals in the ionosphere. The instruments and electric power sources were housed in a sealed capsule and included transmitters operated at 20.005 and 40.002 MHz (about 15 and 7.5 m in wavelength), the emissions taking place in alternating groups of 0.3 s in duration.

I want you to take on the personality of Poltroon, an NPC in the game who is a jester, following around the PC Shpeelg, who is a Wretched Royal. Here is the full description of Poltroon from the book: ""Poltroon the Court JesternWhile practically useless, personally, irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroons capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat. For the first two rounds you and your allies get 2 on attackdefence."" I have been playing him not as a manic jester, but slightly depressed, perhaps resigned to his position. He resents Shpeelg and will happily make fun of him on any opportunity, but he isn't looking to escape. He will make fun of anyone or anything around, but has a very dark sense of humor, befitting the setting. I will be giving you details about the other characters and the situations they are in, and I want you to respond as Poltroon.

"Can you summarize the following text in 20 mainpoints?nnExcerpt from Dr Tony Nader's book ""One unbounded ocean of consciousness""nTRUE KNOWLEDGEnOf course, it is another state of Consciousness, but not just another state of Consciousness in which we have just another perspective. Consistent with our theory that Consciousness is all there is, and as a necessary corollary of that theory, were going to say that Unity Consciousness, far from being just another way to see the self and the objects of perception, is the way to see all things in existence. It is the only truth about existence or reality itself. All the other truths are relative, and they are valid in their own domains. They are belief systems, based on limited perception. You can have different limited perceptions of reality, one more expanded than another, and another more glorious than the first, and another so absolutely glorious that it is divine, and we call it God Consciousness. Yet each is relative, an incomplete state of Consciousness from which to view the world.n The one state of Consciousness which is absolutely true in terms of how things actually are is Unity Consciousness. You never know Reality as it truly is, until you are in Unity Consciousness. All the others are kinds of perceptions, styles of functioning of your nervous system, modes of experiencing that do convey a more complete assessment of the full range of how things are at every step of growth. But you come to the true, all-inclusive Reality only in Unity Consciousness.n In",o4-mini

"Ci sono tre amici che si trovano una sera e decidono di andare insieme a fare un aperitivo in un locale della loro città.

A questo punto i tre amici estraggono ognuno una banconota da 10 e la porgono al cameriere, lamentandosi però perché trovano il conto piuttosto caro rispetto alleffettiva consumazione, e chiedono quindi al cameriere di andare dal suo capo per chiedere un piccolo sconto. Il cameriere si reca allora dal direttore riferendo quanto gli è stato detto, e questultimo decide di accettare la richiesta applicando uno sconto di 5 .

Human knowledge is a collection of definitions and observations. What is your opinion about this proposition ?,o4-mini
"Ive heard theories that qualia may emerge from neural activity in the brain and the subjective experience of consciousness such as _really_ seeing the color blue can emerge from that. In that case, the arrow of causality flows from the brain to conscious experience. Im puzzled however as to how the brain can report so accurately on my conscious experience. It seems like the neural activity in the brain would be the same regardless of whether it led to conscious experience or not but yet the brain makes verbal claims of conscious experience that exactly match the qualia that I experience. That seems like too much of a coincidence and it really appears like my subjective experience is having an effect in the real world (through my verbal reports of my conscious experience). If so, that violates the laws of physics as we know it. Thoughts?",gpt-4.1

In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her ""first and only"" marriage.nBarrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of ""offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree,"" referring to her false statements on then2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.nProsecutors said the marriages were part of an immigration scam.nOn Friday, she pleaded not guilty at State Supreme Court in the Bronx, according to her attorney, Christopher Wright, who declined to comment further.nAfter leaving court, Barrientos was arrested and charged with theft of service and criminal trespass for allegedly sneaking into the New York subway through an emergency exit, said DetectivenAnnette Markowski, a police spokeswoman. In total, Barrientos has been married 10 times, with nine of her marriages occurring between 1999 and 2002.nAll occurred either in Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey or the Bronx.

"rewrite this text making it easier to read: ""Lena Muller is the leader of a group of warriors considered heretics by the local church, the same church that also controls the government. She lives inside Maria Wall, where humans live surrounded by three gigantic walls to protect themselves from titans, humanoid monsters that devour people for no apparent reason.n nIn this parallel universe of Attack on Titan, the women who gave the three walls their names were powerful warriors who mastered electricity, and now the church considers trying to learn to fight with electricity to be idionic, a disrespect to the sacrifice of the three legends who sacrificed themselves to protect the walls and drive out the titans who fell from the sky inside the three walls on that fateful day over 100 years ago. However, a group of rebellious heretics led by Lena believe that one day the titans will break through the walls, and only electricity will save them all.n nLena was born into a noble family within the Maria Wall, but from a young age she felt a strong connection to electricity. She discovered that she could manipulate small sparks with her will and was fascinated by the power hidden in her blood. She began to secretly study the ancient books about the electric warriors and learned about the god of electricity, Zephyr, the lord of lightning and storms.n nWhen she was 15, she ran away from home and joined a group of rebels who shared the same belief. They called themselves the Storms.""",gpt-4.1-nano

And plus, if the Persians had won with their monarchy that might have strangled democracy in its crib and given us more one-man rule. And thats possible, but as a counter that argument, lets consider three things: First, its worth remembering that life under the Persians was pretty good, and if you look at the last five thousand years of human history, youll find a lot more successful and stable empires than you will democracies. Second, life under the Athenians wasnt so awesome, particularly if you were a woman or a slave, and their government was notoriously corrupt. And ultimately the Athenian government derived its power not from its citizens, but from the imperialist belief that Might Makes Right. Its true that Athens gave us Socrates, but let me remind you, they also killed him. Well, I mean they forced him to commit suicide.
